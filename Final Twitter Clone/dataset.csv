BarackObama,"Now we need to keep it up. Because until every single American has access to quality, affordable health care, we have more work to do‚Äîand I‚Äôm grateful to President Biden for continuing to lead the fight."
BarackObama,"The American Rescue Plan lowers premiums for millions of families, makes health insurance more affordable for low-and middle-income Americans, and provides incentives for states to expand Medicaid and cover as many as four million additional Americans."
BarackObama,"And now, thanks to the hard work of President Biden, Senator Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, and Americans all across the country who have spent years fighting against repeal and pushing to improve the law, our starter home is starting to look pretty spacious."
BarackObama,But I‚Äôve always said that the ACA is like a starter home‚Äîit‚Äôs our job to keep tinkering with it and improving it over time.
BarackObama,The Affordable Care Act has helped 20 million Americans get coverage‚Äîand up to 130 million Americans can no longer be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. It has been a lifeline for Americans who've lost their jobs and their health insurance during the pandemic.
BarackObama,"As part of the American Rescue Plan, @POTUS just signed the largest expansion of health care since the Affordable Care Act. It‚Äôs an example of how government is supposed to work, and exactly what I hoped would happen when I signed the ACA into law 11 years ago today. https://t.co/G7WUgYdxOp"

BarackObama,"Like many of you, I‚Äôm thrilled that #MarchMadness is finally back. You can check out my picks here: https://t.co/S5mlQofvAp https://t.co/xyePa9ux2y"
BarackObama,"Michelle and I pray for the victims, their families, everyone grieving these needless and devastating killings‚Äîand we urge meaningful action that will save lives."
BarackObama,Yesterday's shootings are another tragic reminder that we have far more work to do to put in place commonsense gun safety laws and root out the pervasive patterns of hatred and violence in our society.
BarackObama,"Even as we‚Äôve battled the pandemic, we‚Äôve continued to neglect the longer-lasting epidemic of gun violence in America. Although the shooter‚Äôs motive is not yet clear, the identity of the victims underscores an alarming rise in anti-Asian violence that must end."
BarackObama,"Congrats to directors @NicoleNewnham, @JimLeBrecht, and everyone with @CripCampFilm on the Oscar nomination! The heart, passion, and brilliance of those who led the disability rights movement is something to celebrate. Michelle and I hope you'll watch their story on Netflix."
BarackObama,I could not be prouder of the @ChiPubSchools students I spoke with recently about A Promised Land.

BarackObama,"Fifty-six years after Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet over. There are more steps to be taken, more bridges to be crossed. And that‚Äôs why the Obama Presidential Center is designed to honor the giants who carried us and inspire the next generation to lead us forward. https://t.co/0ac3aWgCY0"
BarackObama,This is the kind of progress that‚Äôs possible when we elect leaders across government who are devoted to making people‚Äôs lives better‚Äîand a reminder of why it‚Äôs so important to vote.
BarackObama,"This landmark legislation will help families pay rent and put food on the table, lift millions of children out of poverty, make health care more affordable, aid small businesses, fund broad-based vaccination efforts, and make it easier for states to reopen schools."
BarackObama,Elections matter‚Äîand we‚Äôre seeing why. Congratulations to the Biden Administration and to the American people on a COVID relief bill that will improve the lives of families across the country.
BarackObama,.@BillGates' new book is an exceptionally clear and accessible primer on climate change. He's unblinking in the difficulty of meeting this challenge but maintains a cautious optimism that it can be met‚Äîand provides a framework for action that is both specific and workable. https://t.co/Ukms2M9iK5

BarackObama,"For decades, John Lewis not only gave all of himself to the cause of freedom and justice, but inspired generations that followed to try to live up to his example. On his birthday, we honor his memory, and work toward continuing his legacy by creating change in our communities."
BarackObama,"I want to share this inspiring book about the events leading up to the 1960 election, from Dr. King's imprisonment to student activism in Atlanta to JFK's campaign.

future_of_music,"@michael_hrivnak The argument is that it‚Äôs an inefficient allocation of value, and that the secondary market is inherently good for consumers because it allows market forces to prevail unencumbered."
future_of_music,"@laintrepida Right now, radio pays artists nothing in the United States, and as long as that‚Äôs true, digital services can always say ‚Äúwell, we pay better than radio does!‚Äù"
future_of_music,"@laintrepida There isn‚Äôt a silver bullet solution, in part because the artist community is so diverse. There are lots of smaller things that would help improve the situation. For example: plugging the gaps that currently exist that deflate the marketplace, like radio and YouTube."
future_of_music,"This is not a defense of Spotify, nor of Rogan, whose comments on vaccines and trans people are inexcusable.  Rather, we need to look at the fundamental problems with the model, as well as dysfunction in the broader marketplace."
future_of_music,The answer is unsatisfying:  the 100M to Joe Rogan over multiple years is maybe 1% of overall royalties.  Spotify could kill that deal and give all that money to artists/rightsholders through an improved rate and it wouldn‚Äôt make a meaningful difference. https://t.co/V7wYlEE9ti
future_of_music,"The best economists, of course, embrace complexity and engage with the lived experience of workers and other citizens.  And when they look at industries where they‚Äôre not specialists, they tend to operate from a place of curiosity."
future_of_music,"Economists often tend to see things through the lens of economic theory, and while that can generate insights, it can cause problems, especially with a field like music, which is driven by a whole range of non-economic factors. Market dynamics can‚Äôt tell you the whole story."
future_of_music,Here is an example of how some artists try and keep tickets off the secondary market to better serve fans. Some economists would say this is ‚Äúbad for consumers.‚Äù Economists can be pretty weird! https://t.co/4H6oz0NIB2
future_of_music,"@dada_drummer @MrTomGray Yes, but it‚Äôs gonna take some organizing.  Right now, the priority is to keep members of Congress off the ‚Äúlocal radio freedom act‚Äù which is a resolution the broadcast lobby introduces every congressional session as a vehicle for expressing opposition to the performance right."
future_of_music,"@dada_drummer @MrTomGray With radio right now, it‚Äôs most fundamentally about the structural power of the broadcast lobby. They have stations in every congressional district.  And they scare stations into believing that paying artists would put them out of business."
future_of_music,"@MrTomGray @dada_drummer The lack of a performance right on US radio is inexcusable.  It‚Äôs part of why royalty rates on digital are lower than they ought to be, and so it impacts all artists, not just those who get radio airplay.  Fixing that is a central priority for us."
future_of_music,@dada_drummer And they use those direct deals to achieve savings on licensing costs.
future_of_music,@dada_drummer What happens with Sirius is a good example.  Sirius has the ability to play whatever they want via the statutory.  But they still aggressively pursue direct deals; they have the power to choose not to play  artists (or play them less) if they don‚Äôt agree to Sirius‚Äô terms.
future_of_music,"@dada_drummer Also, it isn‚Äôt giving artists another choice if artists aren‚Äôt the ones choosing.  Spotify already has the option of paying for noninteractive plays through the statutory.  All that said, we love Soundexchange and direct payment and equitable splits."
future_of_music,"@dada_drummer Artists and labels will have a variety of views on that question, but it probably isn‚Äôt realistic to imagine that people are going to rally behind a licensing scheme that forces artists to make everything they put on Bandcamp also available through Amazon or Spotify."
future_of_music,"@dada_drummer Sound recording rightsholders and services may still agree to send noninteractive royalties for nonstatutory uses through Soundexchange for administrative purposes, so artists may not even know that it‚Äôs not being handled through the statutory."
future_of_music,@dada_drummer A service doesn‚Äôt have to use the statutory rate for everything it plays noninteractively.   They can just use the statutory to pay for whatever music they haven‚Äôt gotten covered under direct deals.
future_of_music,@dada_drummer Services that offer both noninteractive and interactive options tend to have licensing infrastructure to facilitate direct deals.  And licensing deals for all service options are usually struck simultaneously.    The use of the statutory is more limited.
future_of_music,"@dada_drummer When a particular offering is classified as ‚Äúnoninteractive‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt mean the service is forced to pay a royalty it wouldn‚Äôt otherwise have to pay, or required to license a certain way.   It just means the service has access to the statutory option."
future_of_music,"@dada_drummer Additionally, when something is classified as noninteractive, services can still negotiate direct deals that don‚Äôt use regulated rates or splits or payment structures; they don‚Äôt even have to send the money through Soundexchange if they‚Äôre not employing the statutory license."
future_of_music,"@dada_drummer That‚Äôs a reasonable take; of course there‚Äôs a risk that a regulated rate ends up being lower than a negotiated rate, and most statutory proposals we have seen would force artists to allow their music on Spotify or Amazon etc regardless of whether they want it there."
future_of_music,@dada_drummer Guaranteed splits would be great but...If Spotify were classified as noninteractive it would pay much much less than it currently does.
future_of_music,The worst has been a report on ‚Äúthe new creative economy‚Äù defined to include people who sell thrift store and flea market stuff on Etsy. https://t.co/mlc08mumAS
future_of_music,"Ethically, structurally, technically, and often legally, music copyright is distinct from issues like access to research, prescription drugs, biotech patents, trademarks and etc. All those issues are thorny and complex, and best addressed without the weight of the others."
future_of_music,"Reminder:  prescription drug patents and music copyrights don't have much to do with each other, and while it might feel nice to bundle everything into a big unifying theory of ""intellectual property,"" that can actually be counterproductive. https://t.co/jdhk6VGCAl"

future_of_music,@Claudia_Sahm Can't agree more.   We're almost to May and only ~20 states have even implemented the mixed earner program.
future_of_music,"Limiting contracts to 7 years--like all other contracts in California--isn't a silver bullet, but it would help avoid those kind of circumstances and rebalance the power dynamics.  https://t.co/qUfoA8W4UY"

future_of_music,"Not every artist needs a label, but labels, even major labels, can be good partners to artists under the right circumstances, helping them achieve creative goals and reach audiences.  Sometimes, though, the balance of power is way off."

timkellernyc,"Only you have complete access to your own selfishness, and only you have complete responsibility for it."
timkellernyc,https://t.co/RtNtPwUyDw
timkellernyc,"If you say: I believed in God, I trusted God, and He didn't come through-You only trusted God to meet your agenda, not a God who could set your agenda."
timkellernyc,Our wisdom tends to be at its peak when our bodies are falling apart.
timkellernyc,https://t.co/NB7O3kjBtM
timkellernyc,"Thanks, Steve! https://t.co/k6t8h6Wfdx https://t.co/AURtV1zgmg"
timkellernyc,It's impossible to meet the real Jesus and leave indifferent.
timkellernyc,To insist others keep their religious beliefs private is itself an unprovable quasi-religious belief.
timkellernyc,Accepting Jesus Christ requires humility because you're admitting that you can't save yourself by your own means.
timkellernyc,"Jesus is one of the following: Lord, Lunatic, Liar, or a Legend. Only four possibilities. Most people don't die for lie (probably not a liar). Not a Legend-too many eyewitnesses (see https://t.co/Cpk3kgar7C), and based on his teachings hard to label him a lunatic."
timkellernyc,The book of Genesis leaves us with a striking truth - work was part of paradise and before the Fall.
timkellernyc,To spell this out...He lost Jerusalem so that we gain the new city in Rev 21-22.
timkellernyc,"Jesus lost the city-that-was, so we could become citizens of the city-to-come."
timkellernyc,"Re-reading Taylor's Sources of the Self. Our culture's views of justice are also driven by its underlying view of identity. Our society acts like this view is a given that all enlightened people accept. That's imperialistic. The Bible provides a subversive, alternative approach."
timkellernyc,Our culture's view of sexuality is based on a view of identity formation that takes too much for granted. It has a particular western historical genealogy and social address that is not as self-evident or as universal as our culture paints. Don't be a pawn.
timkellernyc,"""Consequently, if immigration continues at its current levels (or grows) ‚Äì especially if the religiously unaffiliated continue to¬†have lower birthrates¬†than virtually everyone else ‚Äì demographic changes¬†could help spur¬†increases in American religiosity over time."""
timkellernyc,"""It must be noted that...(worldwide)religion (including Christianity) is growing, not shrinking. This has important implications...immigrants comprise an expanding share of the U.S. population ‚Äì and hail primarily from parts of the world where religious faith is booming."""
timkellernyc,"""Commensurate with Finke and Stark‚Äôs analysis, a¬†recent paper¬†in¬†Sociological Science¬†shows that, actually, there have been¬†no¬†declines in religiosity among those who are intensely religious in the U.S."" https://t.co/Fp3Wt2UM2u"
timkellernyc,Jesus never pulls you in without sending you out.
timkellernyc,"The bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ is intellectually credible and experientially fulfilling. And when a community unites around belief that his resurrection brings the future kingdom of God into the present, it galvanizes for a life of love in word and deed."
timkellernyc,"If the resurrection did not happen, the history of the world is inexplicable. 

See Am I a Christian, Pastor Timothy Keller? https://t.co/y6LM65bMw1 written around Christmas, but discusses Easter which I'm still reflecting on."
timkellernyc,Our bond with others in Christ should be stronger than our relationship to other members of our own racial and national groups.
timkellernyc,Salvation lies not in an escape...but in the transformation of this world‚Ä¶You will not find hope for the world in any of the religious systems or philosophies of humankind‚Ä¶.No faith holds out a promise of eternal salvation for the world‚Äîthe ordinary world...(V.Ramachandra)
timkellernyc,"God sees us as we are, loves us as we are, and accepts us as we are. But by His grace, He does not leave us as we are."
timkellernyc,I'm pretty sure Americans haven't thought out the ramifications of this study. The percentage of religious nones worldwide is shrinking. The world is getting more religious and will have a huge impact on how we see society and each other. Get ready. https://t.co/wYDX24Be4j
timkellernyc,The secular worldview (Bavinck) or imaginary (Taylor) or tradition (MacIntyre) or comprehensive doctrine (Rawls) is a concept of the world and of human nature that lacks the explanatory power it claims for itself and does not make as much sense of human life as Christianity does.
timkellernyc,"Exactly. Refuse to be split, or, perhaps, be both. https://t.co/wgL2Nl9u3D"
timkellernyc,"Real love requires self-giving and commitment. Hence, you can't do biblical justice without it OR follow the Christian sex ethic. Both are rooted in Christ's self-giving, self-sacrificing love. https://t.co/6chNTZa8Ru"

muftimenk,The Almighty will never ignore your pleas. He will never leave you empty-handed. He will replace everything you‚Äôve lost. He will give you something even better when you leave whatever He has prohibited &amp; disallowed.  That‚Äôs how merciful He is &amp; He always wants the best for us!
muftimenk,"We're almost at the halfway mark in #Ramadan.  For those striving hard, keep going. For the rest, it's never too late. The most crucial thing is to finish strong as we enter the last ten nights. The Almighty knows &amp; sees all our efforts, no matter how small. So give it your all!"
muftimenk,"If you take care of your relationship with the Almighty, He will care of you in ways you never imagined. So nurture the relationship and build that bond. He will grant you the strength you need. He is always building you up even when it seems like He‚Äôs breaking you. Trust Him."
muftimenk,"Don‚Äôt wait to turn back to the Almighty. Do it in these blessed days of #Ramadan. The sooner, the better. Seek Him. Thank Him &amp; you‚Äôre on the road to a better life. It‚Äôs a misconception to wait for things to be prefect before you pray. Things will never be perfect. Start now!"
muftimenk,"When you do things the Almighty‚Äôs way, you‚Äôre a winner. Every time. It may not be apparent immediately but it will surely show up eventually. Satan will always intervene. Be sure to protect yourself against His whisperings. Be strong. Remain steadfast and don‚Äôt cave in!"
muftimenk,"Don‚Äôt block your blessings by being bitter about someone else‚Äôs. Keep gratitude alive in your heart. After all, the Almighty has given you more than what you‚Äôve asked for; with more on the way. Recognize that because He can take it away anytime. Being grateful will increase it!"
muftimenk,"Life can be short and unpredictable. You need to come to terms with this and when you finally do, you‚Äôd give up a lot of the unnecessary stress that you cause for yourself. It also becomes easier to give up all the drama, let go of grudges and value what you have in your life!"
muftimenk,"Never say you've nothing to offer someone who's down &amp; needs help. A listening ear, a word of encouragement, kindness or even a smile can lift the person out of his doldrums. Be generous with whatever the Almighty has given you because it will all come back to you one day!"
muftimenk,Almighty. We ask You to forgive all our sins. You know how much we have transgressed and the countless sins we have committed. Do not take us to account for our lack of attention. Do not punish us for messing up repeatedly. Continue to be patient with us. Have mercy on us! Aameen
muftimenk,"In this age of social media, everyone wants overnight fame and instant gratification. Nobody wants to do the hard work. The truth is hard work is the prerequisite. Else nothing is achieved. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise. We need to face the brokenness in order to shine."
muftimenk,"Never tear someone down to build yourself up. You may enjoy momentary bliss but that‚Äôs all; it won‚Äôt last! We may not realize but we tear others down by laughing at them &amp; the things they do, especially when they make mistakes. Stop this! The tables can &amp; will turn. Wait for it!"
muftimenk,"Stop comparing your marriage to what you see online. Couples post pictures making it look like they‚Äôre having a perpetual honeymoon and you fall for it. You get miserable. Wake up. Real life isn‚Äôt like that. Besides, envy is dangerous. Disastrous even; so get offline &amp; on track."
muftimenk,Upholding the ties of kinship is important &amp; severing them is a sin. Use this blessed month to mend  whatever is cracked or broken. Don‚Äôt wait. You‚Äôre missing out on a lot of blessings if you let bad feelings fester between family and relatives. Go on; make the first move!
muftimenk,"You‚Äôre on the verge of giving up because you can‚Äôt stand the pain. You‚Äôre wondering if the Almighty is aware of what you‚Äôre going through. Never doubt He‚Äôs All-Knowing, All-Seeing. Remember, you might be experiencing tremendous pain but the result will be beautiful! Trust Him!"
muftimenk,"Count your blessings instead of your problems. Do that often; you‚Äôll emerge the winner. You‚Äôll find pathways charted for you. The Almighty will grant you strength in times of need, peace in chaos, joy in sadness and hope in hopelessness. The Lord of the Worlds won‚Äôt disappoint!"
muftimenk,"Whatever you want to do, do it soonest possible. Don‚Äôt wait for the perfect time, the perfect moment, the perfect day. It doesn‚Äôt exist. Perfection is not for this world. So before you end up miserable because you‚Äôve been stuck waiting, act on it. Let the Almighty be your Guide."
muftimenk,"The truth is people will talk about you and there‚Äôs not much you can do about it. Don‚Äôt throw yourself into emotional turmoil when you hear what they‚Äôre saying. Remember, the problem is theirs, not yours. If you feel the need to defend yourself against a lie, do it calmly!"
muftimenk,Plug in with the Almighty wholeheartedly. Do it consciously. Don‚Äôt let worldly affairs get in the way. Cut off all the distractions in your path. Those who try to lead you astray. Those who waste your time. Let them all go. Life‚Äôs too short to be engaging in futile activities.
muftimenk,"If their success intimidates or upsets you, then you have a problem. You‚Äôre not fully focused on your own journey. You‚Äôre also letting ego get in the way. Learn to disengage from what others are doing or not doing. Pay no attention to their harsh words too. Mind your own journey."
muftimenk,#Ramadan is a very blessed month. Don‚Äôt waste it. Give it your all. Losing out would be foolish as you may not see the next one. Let us strive to make this the best month. The Almighty has promised forgiveness &amp; huge rewards if you fast solely for His sake. Paradise awaits you.
muftimenk,Don‚Äôt ignore what you think are the small things in life. They could be the ones that bring you the greatest benefit. Don‚Äôt take things for granted. The Almighty puts everything in your life for a reason; to fulfill a purpose. Read the signs. Often you‚Äôre too busy to see them.
muftimenk,"You don‚Äôt need the solution to everything. Some questions don‚Äôt need answers &amp; they‚Äôre better left that way. You just need a firm heart, full of trust and firm belief. A heart full of love &amp; peace. You‚Äôll be amazed at how much more you can get out of the unspoken than just words!"
muftimenk,You‚Äôre feeling ill at ease because you think your life is lacking what you see others have on social media. Don‚Äôt fall for this. Understand that not every voice you hear and every post you see on social media is for you. Learn to be discerning. Protect your clarity of mind!
muftimenk,Looking at the positives when calamity strikes is not for the faint-hearted. You need to have a solid link with your Maker. You understand that difficult times help move you forward. Struggle and strife are standard life lessons. Embrace them and see things in perspective!
muftimenk,"Every chapter in your life serves a purpose. Yes, even the ‚Äòbad‚Äô ones. The Almighty never wastes anything that He puts you through. So whenever you feel hopeless or alone, close your eyes; remember that He‚Äôs with you. He will never abandon you. Trust that better days are coming!"
muftimenk,"Whatever you‚Äôre going through, don‚Äôt quit. Carry on with the journey knowing that something better awaits you. Because He has promised ease after hardship. That should be a good enough reason. When you get through it, you‚Äôre going to be stronger, wiser and more resilient!"
muftimenk,"Almighty. Keep us far away from obscene speech, ignorant acts, argument and insults, not just because we‚Äôre fasting but because they incur Your Wrath. Such actions are often intended to offend, intimidate, cause emotional upheaval etc. Let‚Äôs clean up our acts. #Ramadan"
muftimenk,We are not perfect. We are a work in progress. We will continue to make mistakes. But that‚Äôs part of the process. Don‚Äôt start doubting yourself and your ability. Be kinder to yourself. Allow yourself some leeway. Be guided by the Almighty always and have a blessed journey!
muftimenk,"When the Almighty makes us wait, there‚Äôs wisdom in it. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a punishment. It could be a protection or perhaps, preparation. Always think good thoughts because He always wants the best for us. It may not be what we envisaged but it‚Äôs what we need at that point in time!"
muftimenk,"Don't be so easily deceived by this worldly life. It‚Äôs full of trickery. It will sap your energy &amp; leave you totally exhausted. If &amp; when you eventually get what you want, you‚Äôd have to forgo some aspects of your life. Keep your faith intact! That is non-negotiable at all times!"
muftimenk,"Focus on yourself. Mind your own business. Don‚Äôt start comparing and spoil every blessing you have. Remember, your grass will never get greener by focusing on someone else's lawn. Water your own. Nurture your own. Refocus your energy on your blessings. You‚Äôll reach your goals!"
muftimenk,Let #Ramadan calm you and soothe you. Your soul needs it. Let it cleanse you and purify you and remind you of the countless blessings the Almighty has sent your way. Let your heart be filled with gratitude. Let it soften even more as you do what it takes to get closer to Him!

dzigarkongtrul,"@Aerovideos Rinpoche recommends 1) a commitment to daily practice 2) to do  as much time as you can, with 42 minutes being a good minimum goal. The practice can be shamatha or the Four Immeasurables."
dzigarkongtrul,"4 ~ The three poisons arise in clinging to this belief in the self. It is what we are cherishing and protecting. Yet, it is quite subtle. We can't see its subtlety unless it rises in a swirling manner out of obscurity. Otherwise, it stays in obscurity but shapes our every moment."
dzigarkongtrul,"3 ~ When we are in pain, that very swirling self rises in our chest out of obscurity. This is known as the 7th consciousness. Afflictive consciousness: because it is found to be the cause of cherishing and protecting itself. It is sort of the symbol of the three poisons."
dzigarkongtrul,"2 ~ Physically, that‚Äôs the presence of self. Mentally, we have designated that to be experience of self. Then there‚Äôs the notion of what the self is, the belief in the self being real, meaning, permanent, singular, autonomous, something really there."
dzigarkongtrul,"1 ~ We all have the swirling self that comes out of obscurity, just as your name is being called. Just as you are about to ask a question in the crowd. Just as anything like that, where actually some attention comes on you, the swirling self rises up in your chest from obscurity."
dzigarkongtrul,"When we are against the welfare of others, we are against the welfare of ourselves. #bodhicitta #compassion #buddhist #mahayana"
dzigarkongtrul,"Studying the #emptiness teachings is a wonderful way to spend your life. A wonderful way to get old. And a way to keep your mind sharp, occupied with something meaningful."
dzigarkongtrul,"@recklessrunning Ego is considered extraneous rather than unwanted, though it produces suffering &amp;  no one wants to suffer. Ego is something extra or unnecessary that inhibits the freedom of our original nature. At the same time it is an organic or natural byproduct of ignorance."
dzigarkongtrul,"‚ÄúSamsara"" is found in the state of mind that clings to the self and phenonmena. #buddhism"
dzigarkongtrul,"The Arya Sangha Association of Buddhist Communities in Russia, together with HH Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche, have created a global campaign for ecology, ""Baikal - Pure Chalice of Our Planet.‚Äù Join a day of prayers and rituals on April 22, Earth Day. https://t.co/RzDNYl2aEK"
dzigarkongtrul,"When it is warm with tenderness and affection toward others, our own heart can give us the most pure and profound happiness that exists and enable us to radiate that happiness to others."
dzigarkongtrul,"Being Ordinary

All people have enlightened nature. Everyone‚Äôs hearts are innately imbued with tsewa. Why not cherish what you have in common with all beings rather than make yourself insecure by trying so hard to be special, somehow better than everyone else?"
dzigarkongtrul,"When someone reacts negatively to you or gives you strong feedback, they are speaking to your obscurations, not to your enlightened nature. So feedback can be positive if you admit to your obscurations. Feedback supports your practice of self-reflection."
dzigarkongtrul,"You have no reason to get angry if you are not feeling threatened. Anger is a self-protection that seeks to conquer, avert or abolish the threat. But those ruin our well-being in the end. So there is ‚Äúdeep mental fog‚Äù in the aggression that prevents us from thinking clearly."
dzigarkongtrul,Failure keeps you honest and makes you a better practitioner.
dzigarkongtrul,Observing one‚Äôs mind is more fascinating than any show in the universe. And more fruitful.
dzigarkongtrul,"Well-being can‚Äôt depend solely on outer conditions. It must come from within, from a mind that is flexible, healthy, and resilient."
dzigarkongtrul,"It‚Äôs not about being patient to the maximum level, where you are completely perfect in your being. Rather, as patient as you can be, that much peace you gain."
dzigarkongtrul,"Without creativity, this world would be so gloomy and dark. Art, music, theater, dance, or any creative discipline, bring a lot of joy and is a gift to the world for generations to enjoy."
dzigarkongtrul,"Serving others, good will towards others, is bliss."
dzigarkongtrul,"I believe this world mainly functions based upon people‚Äôs good will to serve humanity. That good will is the seed of buddha nature, and waking up to the buddhanature will happen slowly over time."
dzigarkongtrul,Our deep mental fog is a greater threat to us than any threat that comes from the outside.
dzigarkongtrul,"Shantideva points out that when someone strikes us with a stick, we don‚Äôt get angry at the stick, but at them. In a similar way, that person is being controlled by anger, so we shouldn‚Äôt revile them either, but have compassion for their suffering at the hands of anger."
dzigarkongtrul,"@Emptydidier These are all based almost word for word on Rinpoche‚Äòs teachings or with slight edits here or there, FYI."
dzigarkongtrul,"@Emptydidier Interesting question. Yes, I believe Rinpoche would say that when intention and action are synchronized we can effectively follow the path."
dzigarkongtrul,RT @Emptydidier: @dzigarkongtrul üôèhttps://t.co/q6zZPMLjpv
dzigarkongtrul,"Any state of mind founded in ignorance, in your deep mental fog, is a neurosis, in the sense that it prevents your intention and action to meet. Your intention and action are not synchronized in support of your spiritual path, in support of your happiness and joy. #Buddhism https://t.co/aLgdFE9YoP"
dzigarkongtrul,"Patience practice is not passivity. It‚Äôs a very active management of your mind and emotions, not in a suppressive way, but to enhance your own wisdom and strength to shine forth in a challenging dynamic or situation, in order to change it for the better. #wisdom #patience"
dzigarkongtrul,"As the #Buddha has stated, whether the Tathagatas come into this world or not, the absolute nature of all phenomena is by its own very nature peace, meaning, there is no suffering, sufferer or cause of #suffering ."
dzigarkongtrul,"The more unshakeable you become in your spiritual path, the easier it is to be patient with others."
dzigarkongtrul,"There are two reasons why we get disturbed or angry, according to Shantideva. 1. You‚Äôre not getting what you want. 2. You‚Äôre getting what you don‚Äôt want. If you examine your reactions, you‚Äôll see how true this is. #buddhism #patience #anger"
dzigarkongtrul,"According to Candrakirti, enlightenment has two causes. A universal, unbiased love for all sentient beings and the realization of the wisdom of non-duality."
dzigarkongtrul,"The Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the past sprung from the skandhas and the egos of self and dharmas. They were just like us to begin with. Otherwise, how could they address us now? How could they show us the way out of samsara if not by having found it themselves?"
dzigarkongtrul,Peace is a result of training in tenderness. A peaceful heart needs to be protected by some form of patience or tolerance as we rise from our practice of the Four Immeasurables and go about our day.
dzigarkongtrul,"I use the word ‚Äútender‚Äù( in ""tender-heartedness"") because there is a deep feeling of softness and opening and gentleness that pours out when we attempt to enhance someone‚Äôs welfare. Tender describes that experience of loving-kindness and compassion practice."
dzigarkongtrul,"Our emotions of compassion need to be guided by universal reasoning or wisdom, for example, how all living beings wish to be happy and free from suffering. That logic supports us to practice equanimity hand-in-hand with our compassion, making our compassion that much larger."
dzigarkongtrul,The practice of patience protects our warm-heartedness and the love and care we wish to extend to all beings without exception. One sustains our well-being while the other preserves it.
dzigarkongtrul,"A Wisdom Dharma Chat | Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche https://t.co/5fyAbiZqlK via @FacebookWatch

dzigarkongtrul,"Finally that state has the quality of unconditional love, like that a mother possesses for her only child, and the attendant ability to reach out to others with wisdom, primarily shared through speech or turning the wheel of dharma."
dzigarkongtrul,That state of enlightenment is not merely a state of the cessation of suffering and its cause. That sate has the ability to know. To know what? To know the truth of the universal nature.
dzigarkongtrul,What is enlightenment? Enligtenment is a state in which there is no suffering and no cause of suffering. Suffering and the cause of suffering have both been completely  ceased.

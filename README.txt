There are 4 folders in this zip:

1. Evaluation Experiments - This folder contains the scripts used for the evaluation experiments as well as the data set

2. Final Twitter Clone - This folder contains the final application code with all the features I developed from the start to the end of the project. They are all based on my solution graph model. Instructions of how to start them can be found inside.

3. Snapshot Kiril Solution Model - This folder contains a snapshot of the application code after Week 4 based on my solution graph model and was used only for the experiments for evaluating the performance of the graph model. It can be started using the instructions inside in the readme file but only contains limited functionality that was critical for evaluating the performance of the newsfeed and profile retrieval algorithms. 

4. Snapshot MAX DE MARZI model - This folder contains a snapshot of the application code after Week 4 but based on Max De Marzi's graph model which was also used for the experiments for evaluating the performance of the graph model I derived as a competitor. It can be started with the instructions in the readme file inside and can be used as a basic Twitter clone which follows Max De Marzi's graph model.

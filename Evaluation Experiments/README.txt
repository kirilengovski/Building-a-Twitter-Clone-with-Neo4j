**Evaluation experiments scripts**

This folder contains the Python scripts and the dataset used for the recommendation of users and advanced search functionalities evaluation.

The news_feed.py and profile_retrieval.py are ready to run as they are and do not require a database running.

The recommendation.py however requires a Neo4J database running and populated with appropriate users and posts. To achieve the same results as I did in the report, populated the database with the dataset provided in the dataset.csv and following the instructions explained in the report.

If you need more information on how to populate the database with the provided dataset, please contact me on: engovskiK@cardiff.ac.uk.
